1. len(str(num)) - This property calculates the length of the string representation of the number num. The output is an integer value representing the number of digits in num.

2. sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num)) - This property calculates the sum of the digits in the number num. It converts each digit of the number to an integer using a generator expression and then computes their sum.

3. num % sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num)) - This property calculates the remainder of the number num when divided by the sum of its digits. It uses the previous property to compute the sum of the digits.
